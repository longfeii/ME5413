# This is the homework1 task1 of ME5413,Ay22/23

## The folder mainly contains two parts: code ,picture and .json
Code:
We use Python3.9 to finish task1. They are in jupyternotebook and.py format.

For task1:
For running 'HW1_T1_adjust_parameter', will get the silhouette coefficient of three methods to find the best parameters.

For running 'HW1_T1_DBSCAN','HW1_T1_OPTICS','HW1_T1_Agglomerative' one will get the picture results of cluster by three methods at the optimum parameters and save the boundingbox into json file and result pictures into.
If you want to see the plot, uncomment the plt.show() line.


Picture:
One view of cluster by three methods at the optimum parameters.

.json:
Bounding boxs of cluster results.

Thanks all the authors.
